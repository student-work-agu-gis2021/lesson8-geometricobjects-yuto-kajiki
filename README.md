# Exercise 8: Working with Geometric Objects

This week we will practice how to create geometric objects using Shapely in Python. In the first set of problems (1-2) you will define your own functions for handling geometric objects. In the second set of problems (3-4), you will read in data from a file using Pandas and create geometries based on coordinate information in the input data. 


- **Exercise 8 is due by 7th of June at 9 am**.
